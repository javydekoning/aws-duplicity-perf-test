## Additional notes / tools

Other tools I've considered:

### Kopia

Found at https://kopia.io/docs/ https://github.com/kopia/kopia 

Faster backup performance. Main contributor seems to be the option to use [zstd](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/) compression. 
Written in Go, multi-threaded, support for running in container. 

Can mount backups (snapshots) for file-level restore. 

This would be my tool of choice, however it hasn't reached it's first major version and they only support `+|-` one minor version today. Hence, a concern for storing long-term backups today.

```
kopia repository create filesystem --path /tmp/my-repository 
kopia repository connect filesystem --path /tmp/my-repository
kopia policy set --global --compression=zstd
kopia snapshot create $HOME/Projects/github.com/kopia/kopia --parallel=8
```

### Duplicati2

Not GA, slow release cycle unless when using canary (which might break). Can run in Container, but 
Duplicati team doesnâ€™t maintain their own images.
